        <div class = "description">Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally 
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. 
                Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, 
                making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
