        <h2>This is Mac and Cheese</h2>
        <p>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you 
            have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel sauté pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and 
                smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, 
                about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, 
                making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. 
                Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
